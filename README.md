# Unexpected Implicit Expansion with Logical Arrays in MATLAB

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to implicit expansion when working with logical arrays and the element-wise AND operator.  The standard implicit expansion rules seem to be violated in certain cases involving logical arrays.

## Bug Description
The issue arises when performing an element-wise AND operation (&) between a row vector of logical values and a column vector of logical values.  The expected behavior would be element-wise logical AND, but instead the result is unexpected and inconsistent.

## How to Reproduce
1.  Clone this repository.
2.  Open the `bug.m` file in MATLAB.
3.  Run the `myFunction` function.
4.  Observe the unexpected results in the variable `F`.

## Solution
The solution involves explicitly expanding one of the logical arrays to match the dimensions of the other before performing the element-wise AND operation, ensuring consistent element-wise calculation.
This fixes the unexpected behavior and yields the correct logical AND operation outcome. See `bugSolution.m` for details.
